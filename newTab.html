<!-- Tips
For an effective override page, follow these guidelines:

**Make your page quick and small.
Users expect built-in browser pages to open instantly. Avoid doing things that might take a long time. For example, avoid synchronous fetches of network or database resources.

**Include a title in your page.
Otherwise people might see the URL of the page, which could be confusing. Here's an example of specifying the title: <title>New Tab</title>

**Don't rely on the page having the keyboard focus.
The address bar always gets the focus first when the user creates a new tab.

**Don't try to emulate the default New Tab page.
The APIs necessary to create a slightly modified version of the default New Tab page â€” with top pages, recently closed pages, tips, a theme background image, and so on â€” don't exist yet. Until they do, you're better off trying to make something completely different.
